## Description

- This program uses Python to clone/maintain multiple security related repos using threading and multiprocessing

## Goal

- The goal of this program is to quickly pull and install repos from its list

## Use cases

- Quickly install your favorite Security repos on a new system

- Kick off multiple concurrent git clone tasks utilizing Python

- Add remove repos to the worker_data list as needed in order to address indivudual use case/project needs

## Requirements

- This program was tested with Python version 3.7.2 64-bit
